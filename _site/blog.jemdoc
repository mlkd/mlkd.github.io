My notes on linear algebra, optimization, machine learning and current research could be found [https://machine-learning-wiki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ here]. These notes primarily help me get organized but they also serve as desirable materials to fresh up memory. Moreover, since they are updated regularly, details about my current work could also be found.
